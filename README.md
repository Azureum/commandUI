# COMMANDER

## Overview
Commander is an application that allows you to access your computer from the convenience of your phone. Although there may still be bugs, this is the general application! Contributions are welcome üôèüôèüôè

## How to use? 
- Download Python, search up tutorial on youtube
- Download from my repos CommanderUI, and Commander (Don't need unless local) . Commander is the webapp and CommanderUI is the python app.
- Do pip installs in python terminal

## Local (In your house)
- If you are accessing this locally you don't need to do much all you need to do is run app.py
- ( go to the other repo if you havent )
- open VSC or a code editor that supports commander, then go to the terminal and put in the command  ``` npm run dev ```
- Now run the app.py (if you havent), and go to your mobile device put in the information and login.
-  BOOM

## Access from internet
- This gets more complicated, first go to your router settings and enable port forwarding for port 80
- Go to vercel.com login with an account and import the Commander repo.
- Find the url and put it in on your phone.
- Then run the the app.py on your computer and login.
- BOOM
